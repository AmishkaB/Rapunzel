**Para 1**
There once lived a man and a woman who always wished for a child, but could not have one.  
These people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen.  
The garden was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs. 
 It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an witch, who had great power and was feared by all the world. 

**Para2**
One day the woman was standing by the window and looking down into the garden, 
when she saw a bed which was planted with the most tasty rapunzel.  
It looked so fresh and green that she longed for it and had the greatest desire to eat some.  
This desire increased every day.  The woman knew that she could not get any of it and grew more pale and miserable each day.
