**Para 1**
There once lived a man and a woman who always wished for a child, but could not have one.  
These people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen.  
The garden was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs. 
 It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an witch, who had great power and was feared by all the world.
